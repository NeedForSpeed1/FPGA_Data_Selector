When the selector switch is on, the LED will light up if A (Button W19) is pressed, otherwise it will not.

If the selector switch is off, then the LED will not light up, even if A (Button W19) is pressed. 

The video demonstrates this logic with the switch being turned on with no buttons pressed, with A pressed, with B pressed, and the selector switch off with no buttons pressed, and with A pressed.
